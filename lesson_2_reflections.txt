git init initialized a new empty git repository
git status shows which files have changed since the last commit

### REFLECTIONS

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You initialize a git repository with the command "git init". Without doing this
you won't be able to track commits. "git status" will show all current commits,
as well as all "untracked files" that are currently in the same directory. To
track, you use "git add"

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
